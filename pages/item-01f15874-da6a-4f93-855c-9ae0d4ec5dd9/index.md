What is Ollama?
---------------

Ollama is a free tool that runs AI models locally. It includes a desktop app where you can download a model and chat with it, similar to other AI chat products.

**Why run models locally?**

*   **Privacy** — your data never leaves your machine
*   **No usage costs** — once downloaded, models run for free
*   **Offline access** — works without an internet connection
*   **Experimentation** — try many different models quickly

Prerequisites
-------------

Before starting, make sure you have:

*   A computer with at least **8 GB of RAM** is needed for smaller models, though 16 GB or larger is recommended. The more RAM, the better! This tends to be the hardware component that leads impact on what models can be run, though GPU and CPU are also important.
*   **macOS** or **Windows** (Linux works too, but often involves more setup)
*   An internet connection (for downloading the app and a model)
*   Free disk space (many models are several GB in size)

Step 1: Install Ollama (the background engine)
----------------------------------------------

### macOS

Download the installer from the official website:

1.  Visit [https://ollama.com/download](https://ollama.com/download)
2.  Click the **macOS** button
3.  Open the downloaded `.dmg` file and drag Ollama to your Applications folder
4.  Launch Ollama from Applications — you'll see the llama icon appear in the menu bar

### Windows

1.  Visit [https://ollama.com/download](https://ollama.com/download)
2.  Click the **Windows** download button
3.  Run the installer and follow the prompts

### Linux

1.  Visit [https://ollama.com/download](https://ollama.com/download)
2.  Click the **Linux** button
3.  Copy the installation command into the terminal

Setup may vary by distribution.

Step 2: Make sure Ollama is running
-----------------------------------

Ollama usually runs quietly in the background.

*   **macOS:** Look for the Ollama (llama) icon in the **menu bar**.
*   **Windows:** Look for Ollama in the **system tray** (near the clock) or in your Start menu.

If you don't see it running, open Ollama from your Applications (macOS) or Start menu (Windows).

Step 3: Open the Ollama chat app
--------------------------------

Open the Ollama desktop app.

*   **macOS:** Open **Ollama** from Applications.
*   **Windows:** Open **Ollama** from the Start menu.

If you see a chat screen, you're in the right place.

Step 4: Select and download a model
-----------------------------------

In the Ollama app, there is a models drop-down in the chat bar. Choose one already downloaded or select a new one to download and use the model.

### Models and descriptions (as of this writing)

Models are updated frequently, so you may also want to do some research on your own to identify the best model for your needs.

Model

Best for

Pros

Cons

`phi3`

Everyday Q&A, quick drafts, basic help

Fast on most computers, smaller download, good "starter" model

Less accurate than larger models, not as strong for complex writing or reasoning

`llama3.2`

General-purpose chat, writing help, study help

Strong all-around, better answers than very small models

Larger download, can feel slower on older laptops

`gemma3`

Great general chat, summarizing, (sometimes) image + text questions

Very capable for a wide range of tasks; available in multiple sizes

Some sizes are a bigger download; may feel slower on older machines

`qwen3`

Clear writing, structured answers, multi-step tasks

Strong instruction-following; lots of size options

Larger sizes can be heavy; smaller sizes may be less accurate

`deepseek-r1`

Reasoning-heavy questions (math, logic, planning)

Often stronger at "think it through" tasks

Can be slower; can produce longer answers than you want

`mistral`

Writing and summarization

Good balance of quality and speed

Older than some newer families; quality varies by use case

`llama3.3`

Highest-quality chat (if you have a powerful computer)

Excellent results when your hardware can handle it

Very large download and resource use; not recommended for most laptops

Tip: If you're not sure, start with `phi3`. If you want better answers and your computer can handle it, try `llama3.2`, `gemma3`, or `qwen3`.

Pick a beginner-friendly model, then download it:

*   **Smaller / faster:** `phi3`
*   **Balanced:** `llama3.2`

Notes:

*   Model downloads can be several GB and may take a while.
*   If your computer feels slow or hot, choose a smaller model.

Step 5: Start a new chat
------------------------

Once a model is downloaded, select it in the app's chat bar.

Type your first message to create a new chat.

Step 6: Try a quick chat
------------------------

In the Ollama app, try asking:

*   "Summarize this paragraph in 3 bullet points: ..."
*   "Help me write a polite email."
*   "Explain photosynthesis like I'm 12."

If responses are too slow, switch to a smaller model.

Step 7 (Optional): Remove models to free up disk space (Terminal)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Models can take up a lot of storage. If you want to remove a model you no longer use, you can do it from the terminal.

Open a terminal:

*   **macOS:** Applications -> Utilities -> Terminal
*   **Windows:** Start menu -> Windows Terminal (or PowerShell)

List your installed models:

    ollama list
    

Remove a model:

    ollama rm phi3
    

**Note:** You may be asked to enter your password. Just be careful with the `rm` command, this permanently deletes files from your computer.

If a model will not remove, make sure it is not currently selected or running in the Ollama app, then try again. You may also need to restart your computer.
